# CMB Coding Challenge Starace

Thanks to everyone who is reviewing this code. I would absolutely love as much feedback as possible. I appreciate the personal touch of creating a Meet The Team app.

# MVP

I chose to use an MVP pattern for the recycler view. This may not be a perfect implementation but due to time restrictions I used a simple implementation. Could have used things like dependency infection and data binding to improve the pattern. I chose to use two models one for, what would normally be a network call, and another for populating the view. Using the two models helps to remove and logic from model that populates the view.

# Base Activity

I used a base activity to provide the toolbar functionality to both the main and detail activity. In a two-activity app it is a bit overkill but it does represent how I might use a base activity in a more complex application.

# Thank you
